      Pastor Inzemaan Samir Mirza was born on May 19, 1993 to parents Imaan and Valerie Mirza. He has lived all his
      life in Chase Village and was born into a Muslim home. At the young age of five his mother began attending
      church and from then until
      age
      eleven he attended both mosque and church.
    </p>
    <p style=" line-height: 30px !important; text-justify: auto;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s">
      At eleven his relationship with God grew to the level where he
      decided to follow Jesus in water baptism. After baptism Inzemaan was faithful in serving God in ministries
      such as drama, puppets,
      evangelism,
      visitation, vacation bible school, Sunday school, youth ministry and anywhere the opportunity arose. At age
      fourteen Inzemaan knew that he was called to Pastoral ministry however, he expected God to call him at an
      older age but God was ready for
      him at age twenty-three.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 30px !important; text-justify: auto;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s">
      In 2012, Inzemaan graduated from Presentation College Chaguanas with a National
      Scholarship in Mathematics. Inzemaan then went on to the University of the West Indies where he completed a
      Bachelor’s in Electrical and
      Computer Engineering. It was at university where the friendship between Inzemaan and Jessica grew. His wife
      was pursuing her Bachelor’s in Pharmacy at that time. Even though both knew each other from attending the same
      church this is where their
      relationship evolved. They both graduated University in 2015 and then got engaged in 2017. Before getting
      married in 2018, Inzemaan completed a Certificate in Ministerial Studies and served as a Youth Pastor. It was
      in October of 2019 while
      serving
      as an Assistant Pastor that God birthed the vision in his heart to start Influence Church.
    </p>

    <p style=" line-height: 30px !important; text-justify: auto;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s">
      Construction began
      in November of 2019 and just a few months later by the miracle working power of God, Influence Church was
      launched on March 7, 2020.
      Currently Inzemaan works as an Electrical Engineer at the Ministry of Works and Transport and Jessica is a
      Pharmacist with the South-West Regional Health Authority. Because God has blessed them with full-time jobs
      they both have chosen not to be
      salaried by the church. Pastor Inzemaan believes that we serve God in both our career and our calling and the
      both cannot be separated hence the vision for Influence church to raise up leaders that will influence our
      current and future
      generations.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 30px !important; text-justify: auto;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s">
      As Lead Pastor of Influence Church, Inzemaan is determined to raise up leaders not followers, to have a habit
      of excellence, to influence our culture, community and country, to foster entrepreneurs who have vision from
      God and to serve God by
      serving people.
