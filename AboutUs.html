  Pastor Inzemaan Samir Mirza was born on May 19, 1993 to parents Imaan and Valerie Mirza. He has lived all his life in Chase Village and was born into a Muslim home. At the young age of five his mother began attending church and from then until age
  eleven he attended both mosque and church. At eleven his relationship with God grew to the level where he decided to follow Jesus in water baptism. After baptism Inzemaan was faithful in serving God in ministries such as drama, puppets, evangelism,
  visitation, vacation bible school, Sunday school, youth ministry and anywhere the opportunity arose. At age fourteen Inzemaan knew that he was called to Pastoral ministry however, he expected God to call him at an older age but God was ready for
  him at age twenty-three. In 2012, Inzemaan graduated from Presentation College Chaguanas with a National Scholarship in Mathematics. Inzemaan then went on to the University of the West Indies where he completed a Bachelor’s in Electrical and
  Computer Engineering. It was at university where the friendship between Inzemaan and Jessica grew. His wife was pursuing her Bachelor’s in Pharmacy at that time. Even though both knew each other from attending the same church this is where their
  relationship evolved. They both graduated University in 2015 and then got engaged in 2017. Before getting married in 2018, Inzemaan completed a Certificate in Ministerial Studies and served as a Youth Pastor. It was in October of 2019 while serving
  as an Assistant Pastor that God birthed the vision in his heart to start Influence Church. Construction began in November of 2019 and just a few months later by the miracle working power of God, Influence Church was launched on March 7, 2020.
  Currently Inzemaan works as an Electrical Engineer at the Ministry of Works and Transport and Jessica is a Pharmacist with the South-West Regional Health Authority. Because God has blessed them with full-time jobs they both have chosen not to be
  salaried by the church. Pastor Inzemaan believes that we serve God in both our career and our calling and the both cannot be separated hence the vision for Influence church to raise up leaders that will influence our current and future generations.
  As Lead Pastor of Influence Church, Inzemaan is determined to raise up leaders not followers, to have a habit of excellence, to influence our culture, community and country, to foster entrepreneurs who have vision from God and to serve God by
  serving people.
